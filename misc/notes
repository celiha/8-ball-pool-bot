Pool Ball Detection

All balls are surrounded by a thin dark shadow which I can use to detect the balls.

The shadows themselves can get quite light and vary from greyscale values.



When the turn transfers from opponent to the current player, the bar which 
displays the timer on the current player will flash green (0,255,0).
The frame before this happens, the bar will be grey (96,96,96) and all balls
will be static and the cue will not be visible.
This should be the frame which I use to determine the positions of each ball on the table.

If instead the player pockets a ball, their bar will transform from the state
it was in when the shot was made, to full green (0,255,0).
The frame before full green should be when I record ball positions.
I can detect this by looking at the loading pixels which have already been 
removed. These pixels should be (49,46,57), however this tets must be pixel
perfect in the y direction.
Also, since this method relies on the loading bar being slightly removed, I must
ensure that the previous potting shot was slow enough that some of the bar has
moved away (although this seems unlikely to happen in practice).
